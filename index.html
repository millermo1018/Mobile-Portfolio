            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Hi there and Welcome to Chicago in Color! My name is Morgan Miller and I am a young black woman from the Southside of Chicago. Chicago is the greatest city in the world, if I do say so myself. It is referred to by some as "The Second City","The
                Windy City", and "Chi-town". To MY generation it is fondly and more commonly known as The GO or The Chi. As a Chicago native and lover of all that this city has to offer, I was inspired to make this website to showcase some of my personal
                favorite restaurants, health & wellness places, and fashion brands. Chicago in Color is a website dedicated to Black Owned Businesses and Brands in the Chicago land area. My hope for Chicago in Color is to shed light on Chicago based businesses
                and inspire people to experience Chicago in Color.</p>
