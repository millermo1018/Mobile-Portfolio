            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Hi there and Welcome to Chicago in Color! My name is Morgan Miller and I am a young black woman from the Southside of Chicago. Chicago is the greatest city in the world, if I do say so myself. It is referred to by some as "The Second City","The
                Windy City", and "Chi-town". To MY generation it is fondly and more commonly known as The GO or The Chi. As a Chicago native and lover of all that this city has to offer, I was inspired to make this website to showcase some of my personal
                favorite restaurants, health & wellness places, and fashion brands. Chicago in Color is a website dedicated to Black Owned Businesses and Brands in the Chicago land area. My hope for Chicago in Color is to shed light on Chicago based businesses
                and inspire people to experience Chicago in Color.</p>

                Lincoln Ave, Chicago, IL 60614. The doors to Batter & Berries opened up back in 2012 by Dr. Tanya & Craig Richardson who had the passion to add an eclectic world class restaurant to brunch scene in the city.The popular breakfast spot has
                been serving up creative offerings, such as decadent French toast flights and deconstructed omelets, and so much more. While Batter & Berries is most known for their take on breakfast food items, the restaurant also serves Lunch and Dinner.
                With multiple locations in the city, coffee lovers have the option to visit the Bronzeville, Hyde Park, or Rosenwald location. This coffee house, established in 2005 by Trez V. Pugh III Chicagoans from all walks of life who stop in for
                a break, a good cup of coffee and great community-focused conversations. Known for its exceptional quality and flavor, Sip & Savor coffees are certified fair trade, and in some cases, certified organic and shade grown. Be sure to stop
